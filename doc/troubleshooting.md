# üö® Error handling & Troubleshooting

Not all errors are the same ‚Äî and not every issue means something is broken.

This card is designed to gracefully handle common errors in your Lovelace configuration or entity state. These are usually minor and expected, and the card will notify you directly in the UI when they occur (for example, a missing entity or invalid value).

However, you might encounter a real bug ‚Äî something unexpected that breaks functionality and requires further investigation. That‚Äôs where troubleshooting comes in.

## ‚ùó Error handling

This card includes error handling to prevent visual issues and ensure the UI
stays clean and stable. We handle two main categories of errors in the card:

1. **Configuration Errors**
    These occur when the card is incorrectly set up in the Lovelace config.
    Examples:

    - Missing entity ID
    - Invalid or unsupported attributes
    - Incorrect min/max values

2. **Runtime Errors (Entity State Issues)**
    These happen while the card is running and are related to the entity‚Äôs
    current state. Examples:
    - Entity is not found, unavailable or offline

## üêû Troubleshooting

### Introduction

Despite all efforts to provide a stable and bug-free card, you might still encounter an issue.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't panic! And above all, do not delete your dashboards!**

> removed, or broken in your actual setup.
